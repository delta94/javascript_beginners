JavaScript Beginners
====================

These are files for teaching JavaScript to beginners.

[MDN's JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) resources are the best place to look stuff up.

Having a foundation in JavaScript makes it easier to learn [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), which is a JavaScript library.

Here's a Powerpoint I use in class: [JavaScript 101](http://www.slideshare.net/macloo/javascript-101-16754994).

**Note:** These pages, buttons, and forms work on Mac iOS. Not tested on Android, however. 

##number.html + scripts/number.js

This HTML page and its accompanying JavaScript file are designed as an exercise using pop-up dialog boxes. You'll code a number-guessing game. You should be able to do this exercise if you have completed exercises 1-8 in [Codecademy's JavaScript track](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript).

##quiz.html + scripts/quiz.js

This quiz runs locally, not communicating with a Web server. You can use it to get an idea of how JavaScript is used with HTML form elements. MDN's [HTML forms guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms) is a good reference for HTML forms.
