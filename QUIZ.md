Simple JavaScript Quiz
======================

This is a JavaScript exercise for beginners. You should be able to modify this quiz without breaking it. There are two files:

+ quiz.html
+ scripts/quiz.js

Your mission is to add one **new** complete question to the quiz. Add it after the existing question 4. Be careful to follow all the formatting conventions for the names, IDs and labels in the HTML. 

You will need to modify the JavaScript file *as well as* the HTML file. Otherwise, your new question will be ignored.

Do not delete or change any of the four existing questions in the quiz.
